# CLAUDE.md

Handoff for continuing work on HANDSHAKE. Read this first.

## What this is

A web tool: send a **short secret as a dial-up modem transmission**. You type a message, it's encrypted in the browser and relayed; a strong **key** is generated to share out of band. Whoever has the key tunes into that key's thread, hears the transmission and reads it off the subtitles. No key, no message. `index.html` is the whole frontend — HTML, CSS, JS inline. No framework, no build step, no frontend dependencies. The modem half runs from a bare `file://` (sending/listening needs the API).

The networked half is one zero-dependency serverless function (`api/messages.js`) talking to a Redis-compatible KV store. It only ever sees ciphertext, addressed by a hash of the key. The frontend stays a single file and degrades to `BOARD OFFLINE` when the API isn't there, so the modem still works standalone. Don't add more network surface without a strong reason.

## Working style (Pav)

- Terse. Decisions over options. Specifics over abstractions.
- Don't ask permission to edit the file — just do it and report what changed.
- No slop prose in code comments or UI copy. Plain and direct.
- Verify JS parses after edits (`node -e` Function-constructor check, see below) before claiming done.
- When the look needs to match a reference, match it precisely — colors, layout, chrome — not "in the spirit of."

## Architecture (all inside index.html)

**Synthesis (pure functions, return Float32Array @ 44100 Hz):**
- `tone(dur, freqs[], amp)` — additive sines, used for DTMF and pure tones
- `fsk(bits[], baud, fMark, fSpace, amp)` — frequency-shift keying (Bell 103 / V.21 / V.23)
- `psk(bits[], baud, f, amp)` — phase-reversal keying (the V.22 "wah")
- `ansam(dur)` — 2100 Hz answer tone with 15 Hz AM and phase reversals
- `sweep`, `noise`, `bong` — line probe, training garbage, the decaying sentence-end "bong"
- `env(arr, n)` — 3 ms edge fades, applied to nearly everything to kill clicks
- `byteBits(b)` — UTF-8 byte → 8N1 frame (start 0, 8 data LSB-first, stop 1)
- `richChar(ch, wordN, spd)` — the voice palette. Maps a char to a modulation by `codePointAt % 4`, with special cases for space / `.!?` / `,;:` / DTMF digits. **This is the function to touch for new "voices."**
- `lineize(x)` — in-place phone-line coloration on the final mixed buffer. Bandpass + saturation + hiss + 50 Hz hum + crackle. Single biggest contributor to "sounds like a real modem."

**Orchestration:**
- `synth(mode, text, spd, label)` — builds the full timeline. `mode='boot'` → handshake sequence; `mode='msg'` → per-char payload. Pushes subtitle `events` ({t, who, txt}) and `charTimes[]` as it goes. Returns `{f32, events, charTimes, dur, text, label}`. An empty `txt` on an event means "type the payload text out live."
- `play(o, kind)` — wires an AnalyserNode for the spectrogram, starts the buffer, kicks the rAF loop.
- `frame()` — per-frame: scrolls the spectrogram one column (drawImage shift + new column from `getByteFrequencyData`), updates the subtitle (typing effect when event txt is empty), drives the OH/CD/RD/SD flags. On boot completion sets `connected=true` and flips the button to Transmit. On completion also calls `playFromQueue()` to advance a PLAY ALL run.

**State:** `connected` gates boot-vs-transmit. `boot`/`help` cache their synthesized results; per-message playback caches in `feedCache` by id. `playText` holds the string the typing subtitle reveals. **Speed is fixed 1x** (the old ½x/SPDS control was removed).

**UI:** Norton Commander skin. Top menu (Line/Transmit/Listen/Help — all tappable) is a gray Turbo-Vision menu bar (black text, red hotkeys, cyan selection), two double-framed panels (TERMINAL / SECRET), bottom = `C:\HANDSHAKE>` prompt + status flags + ONLINE clock + F-key row (1 Connect/Transmit, 2 Listen, 3 New key, 4 Copy key, 10 Quit). A `≤480px` media query hides the top wall-clock and the prompt and tightens the status bar. Number keys 1–4 are bound (ignored while typing in the textarea or KEY field).

**Secret thread (`index.html` JS + `api/messages.js`):** the board is per-**key** threads of encrypted transmissions — no public browsing. With no key you see nothing.
- Crypto: AES-GCM 256 via WebCrypto. `aesKey(pass)` derives the key with PBKDF2 (120k iters, SHA-256) from a *deterministic* salt (`SHA-256('handshake.v1:'+pass)`) so two people sharing a key derive the same key (symmetric); cached in `keyCache`. `encMsg` prepends a random 12-byte IV (the "randomiser") to the ciphertext, base64; `decMsg` returns `null` on auth failure. `channelId(pass)` = `b64url(SHA-256('handshake.ch:'+pass)).slice(0,24)` — the public address the key posts/reads on; the server never sees the key. `genKey()` makes an ~80-bit base32 key (`XXXX-XXXX-...`). **Real crypto but a toy** — timestamps public, weak keys guessable, no forward secrecy.
- Frontend: the `C:\SECRET` panel — `KEY` field (`#key`, persisted in `localStorage` as `hs_key`) + `COPY`/`NEW`, a `#msg` textarea, `► TRANSMIT`/`► PLAY ALL`/`■ STOP`, and a play-only `#feed` thread (`.fi` items are `[HH:MM] ► PLAY`; the text lives in the subtitles). `onTransmit()` connects on first press, else: if no key, `genKey()`; `loadThread()` (which resets the thread + computes `activeChannel`), plays your plaintext locally, POSTs `{channel, enc}`, clears the textarea. `loadThread(key)` switches the active channel and `pollThread()`s it; the KEY input debounces into `loadThread`. `addItem()` decrypts with `activeKey` and skips anything that doesn't decrypt. PLAY ALL walks a `queue` advanced from `frame()`. Polls the active channel every 4 s.
- Backend: `api/messages.js`, a Vercel Node serverless function, **no npm deps** — Redis REST via global `fetch`, creds resolved by env-var *suffix*. `GET ?channel=<c>&since=<id>` returns that channel's `{id,t,enc}` after `since` (validates channel against `/^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,64}$/`; bad/absent → empty). `POST {channel,enc}` validates, rate-limits 5/10 s per IP, monotonic `id` via `INCR chat:seq`, `RPUSH ch:<channel>`. Append-only — **never trimmed**.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Sample rate is 44100 everywhere.** AudioContext is constructed with `{sampleRate: SR}`. Don't mix rates.
- **Audio needs a user gesture.** First sound must come from a click/tap (currently `1 Connect`). Don't try to autoplay on load.
- **Textarea + KEY input are 16px on purpose** — anything smaller makes iOS Safari zoom on focus. Rest of the TUI is 14px. Keep inputs at 16.
- **CP437 typography only in UI copy.** DOS can't render `—`, `…`, or curly quotes — use `-`, `...`, straight `'`. `→`, `½`, `≈`, `│`, `►`, `■`, `█` *are* CP437, fine to use. (Straight `'` inside a single-quoted JS string must be escaped: `let\'s`.)
- **The relay needs the deployed `/api` + a KV store.** Threads read `BOARD OFFLINE` from `file://` or before the KV integration is connected — expected, not a bug. Provision KV in the Vercel dashboard (Storage → KV/Upstash) so the env vars get injected.
- **`env()` everything** that starts/stops abruptly or you get clicks. `bong` intentionally skips the tail fade (it decays naturally).
- **Speed is fixed 1x.** `richChar`/`synth` still take a `spd` arg (always 1) so the per-char timing math stays intact; don't reintroduce a speed control without a reason.
- **WebCrypto needs a secure context** (https, which Vercel is). On bare `file://` the crypto/relay won't work — only the modem half does.
- **Determinism matters.** `richChar` (per-char pitch from a pentatonic `NOTES` table) is fixed so a given word always "sings" the same. The handshake uses a seeded PRNG (`rbit`). Keep new voices deterministic.

## Verify after editing

```
node -e "const s=require('fs').readFileSync('index.html','utf8');const m=s.match(/<script>([\s\S]*)<\/script>/);new Function(m[1]);console.log('JS OK');"
```

Then open in a browser and actually listen — the audio is the product, lint can't catch a bad-sounding tone.

## Deploy

Vercel, zero build config — `index.html` static, `api/messages.js` auto-detected as a function. `vercel --prod`. **One-time:** add a KV/Upstash database in the project's Storage tab and redeploy, or threads stay `BOARD OFFLINE`. `vercel.json` sets clean URLs + cache headers; the function overrides with `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## v2 backlog (not started, rough priority)

0. **Thread scale/abuse.** Append-only, never-trimmed; `GET` caps at 200 per channel; no expiry. Add read pagination + maybe per-thread TTL/burn-after-read before it gets used in anger. (No global moderation surface now since nothing is public without a key.)
1. **Decoder mode.** Demodulate modem audio back to bytes — ideally another phone *listening via mic*. Combined with the encrypted feed this is the endgame: encode → transmit → listen → decode → decrypt (airgapped secret transfer over sound). Hardest part is FSK/PSK demod that tolerates the lineize coloration + speaker→mic noise — needs a cleaner, error-corrected "decodable" TX mode separate from the pretty rich TX. The current locked-item audio is just a ciphertext *burst* for vibe, not a real decodable channel.
2. **WebM/video export.** Capture the spectrogram canvas + audio to a shareable clip (MediaRecorder + canvas.captureStream + a WebAudio MediaStreamDestination), so the *animation* shares, not just the WAV.
3. **CP437 bitmap font** (Perfect DOS VGA 437 or similar) instead of system mono, for true DOS authenticity. Needs a bundled webfont — breaks the zero-asset single-file purity, so decide if that tradeoff is worth it.
4. **Shareable message links.** Encode message+speed in the URL hash so a link auto-loads (and maybe auto-plays after a tap). Pairs well with deploy.
5. **QAM "data" voice** as an optional fifth modulation — authentic 56k hiss, but melodically dead, so opt-in only.

## History

Built iteratively in a chat session: started as amber-oscilloscope text-to-Bell-103, went through "sounds like uniform noise" fixes (handshake pacing, inter-char rhythm), added the polyphonic voice palette, the lineize line coloration, speed control, then skinned amber → green CRT → flat tty → DOS comm program → Norton Commander. Then: connect-on-first-press flow (handshake as warm-up, not splash), removed toggles, 16px input, Help-as-transmission. Then: tightened the Norton skin, added a shared chat board, made it an encrypted feed. Latest: **pivoted from a public feed to a secret-transmission tool** — per-key threads addressed by `SHA-256(key)`, transmit generates+shares a strong key, listen pastes a key to tune in, play-only (read off the subtitles). Dropped speed control (fixed 1x), the handle, and WAV save/share to keep it fast and minimal.
